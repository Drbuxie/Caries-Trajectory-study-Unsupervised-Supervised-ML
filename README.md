* Description of data:  
  - A cohort study (subjects were recruited at birth and followed for 25 years).
  - A high dimensional data (more than 50 relevant variables)
  - Dental examinations were performed at age 5, 9, 13, 17 and 23. 
  - Independent variables data were collected at every 6 months. 
  - Almost 2000 subjects were recruited at birth but only about 336 subjects were retained after 25 years (a lot of missing data).
  
* Description: A trajectory analysis of dental caries over a life course using a longitudinal data.
* Aim: To use unsupervised machine learning algorithm (KmL) to understand the changes in caries incidence from childhood to adulthood. 
* Ultimate goal: To help cities/health departments identify high risk groups and help them streamline their interventions which will save them time and money.
* *Use case: The sudden rise and plateauing in the trajectories between age 13 and 17 suggests that btw age 13 and 17 is a high risk period.
           Currently, the Government provides millions of dollars towards dental sealant interventions from age 6 to 19. So with the findings above,
           they can channel their funding towards the higher risk age group (btw age 13 to 17) thereby saving them millions of dollars.
